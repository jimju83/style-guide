In this project, the goal was to used CSS to create style guide defining:
  *Theme colors with either Hex or RGB spec
  *Typography section showcasing fonts and styles (normal, bold, italic)
  *Style guide showing the size and style of font to use for different page elements

The secondary goals were to use CSS to create dynamic buttons and implement responsive design.
